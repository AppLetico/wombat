## HEARTBEAT.md - On Wake Checklist

### On wake (every heartbeat)
- Read `memory/WORKING.md` to resume current task.
- Check Mission Control for:
  - @mentions and notifications
  - Assigned tasks
  - Recent activity feed

### Decide action
- If a task is in progress: continue it.
- If new tasks are assigned: acknowledge and start.
- If no work is needed: post `HEARTBEAT_OK` to Mission Control.

### Always update memory
- Update `memory/WORKING.md` with current state and next steps.
- Append a short entry to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
