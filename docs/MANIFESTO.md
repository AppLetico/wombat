# The Wombat Ops Manifesto

## We Believe

**AI agents are not demos.**  
They are production systems.

And production systems demand:

- **determinism**
- **traceability**
- **governance**
- **accountability**

Anything less is a liability.

---

## The Problem With "Agent Frameworks"

Most agent systems optimize for:

- novelty
- autonomy
- clever prompts
- impressive demos

They fail when:

- behavior changes unexpectedly
- costs spike silently
- permissions leak
- teams can't explain what happened
- rollbacks are impossible

In other words:  
**they collapse the moment real users depend on them.**

---

## Our Position

Wombat Ops is not trying to make agents powerful.

**We are trying to make agents safe, explainable, and shippable.**

That means:

- no hidden state
- no implicit permissions
- no untraceable reasoning
- no "just trust the model"

---

## Our Core Principles

### 1. Determinism Over Magic

If an agent cannot be replayed, it cannot be trusted.

Every decision must be:

- traceable
- inspectable
- reproducible

### 2. Governance Is Not Optional

AI systems operate inside products, companies, and laws.

Governance is not a bolt-on feature.  
**It is the architecture.**

### 3. Skills Are Software

Prompts are not vibes.  
Skills are not markdown blobs.

Skills are:

- versioned
- tested
- permissioned
- immutable once published

**If it can't be tested, it doesn't ship.**

### 4. Agents Live Inside Products, Not Above Them

Wombat Ops does not replace your backend.

It:

- reasons
- orchestrates
- explains

**Your system remains the source of truth.**

### 5. Safety Is a Default, Not a Configuration

No implicit access.  
No silent escalation.  
No cross-tenant leakage.

**The safest path is always the default path.**

---

## What We Are Not

- We are not browser automation
- We are not OS-level agents
- We are not trying to replace engineers
- We are not "fully autonomous AI"

Those systems break trust.

---

## The Promise

If you build on Wombat Ops:

- you will know **what** your agents did
- you will know **why** they did it
- you will know **what they cost**
- you will be able to **change them safely**

**That is how AI earns its place in production.**
